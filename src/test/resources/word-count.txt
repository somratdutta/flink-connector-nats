NATS is an open-source messaging system (sometimes called message-oriented middleware).
The NATS server is written in the Go programming language.
Client libraries to interface with the server are available for dozens of major programming languages.
The core design principles of NATS are performance, scalability, and ease of use.
The acronym NATS stands for Neural Autonomic Transport System.
Synadia develops and provides support for NATS.
NATS was originally developed as the messaging control plane for Cloud Foundry and was written in Ruby.
NATS was later ported to Go.
